# A table-of-content extension of Craft app

## About

A simple table-of-content extension of Craft app. Since the official API of Craft is still in developer preview, this extension may not work as expected. Please get in touch with me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/itshxu) or just [mail to me](https://mailto:its.hxu@gmail.com).

## Install

Two ways to install this extension:
- just [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itshxu/craft-x-table-of-content/master/dist/Table%20of%20Content.craftx) the `.craftx` file
- or clone this repo and build locally.

## Feedback

Any idea or feedback on this extension or anything else about Craft and personal knowledge management is welcome. Hope you enjoy this simple extension.
